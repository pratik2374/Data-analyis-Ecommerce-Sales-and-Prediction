# E-commerce Sales Analysis and Prediction

## Abstract
E-commerce is the new way of shopping in this new era, especially in a covid pandemic when people are unable to walk outside but still want to shop. As a result, online shopping has become a popular option for customers, and it is useful to forecast e-commerce sales volume. So, the main objective of the project is to build the prediction model and try to develop special sales. In this project, I applied different machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Random Forest, for the dataset and find out the algorithm which fits this dataset. Taken RMSE evaluation parameter to find the performance of the models. For this project, I used Jupiter Notebook (Anaconda Navigator) User Interface where I will use python to build the models.

## Project Overview
In this new era, e-commerce has become a significant shopping trend. Customers' information is acquired in bulk by online retailers, who store it in a database for future use. Online Retail evaluated the data and its pattern throughout the year. With access to such a massive amount of data, E-Commerce will be able to create a game-changing environment for the E-Commerce firm. This industry has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising, social media, data sorting, and other methods to increase sales, but they did not anticipate that machine learning would help them outperform their competition. Data mining, artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and prediction is just a few of the specializations in machine learning. The e-commerce platform will be able to make better business decisions if it can estimate income for the following month or day. They will be able to observe and analyze sales trends if a festival or event occurs yearly. I tried different machine learning approaches in this project, including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Random Forest, to determine which one best matches the data. To determine the performance of the models, the RMSE evaluation parameter was used.

## Dataset
- **Source**: Online Retail Dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository)
- **Size**: 541,909 rows, 8 columns
- **About Data**: The dataset includes several columns: `InvoiceNo`, which is a unique transaction ID; `StockCode`, serving as the product identifier; `Description`, providing details about the product; `Quantity`, indicating the number of units purchased; `InvoiceDate`, which is the timestamp of the transaction; `UnitPrice`, representing the price per unit of the product; `CustomerID`, a unique identifier for customers; and `Country`, denoting the country of purchase.

### Sample Data
```
  InvoiceNo StockCode                          Description  Quantity  
0    536365    85123A   WHITE HANGING HEART T-LIGHT HOLDER         6   
1    536365     71053                  WHITE METAL LANTERN         6   
2    536365    84406B       CREAM CUPID HEARTS COAT HANGER         8   
3    536365    84029G  KNITTED UNION FLAG HOT WATER BOTTLE         6   
4    536365    84029E       RED WOOLLY HOTTIE WHITE HEART.         6   
```
## Methods
For this project, I used Jupiter Notebook (Anaconda Navigator) User Interface where I will use python to build the machine learning models. I split the project into four phases.
(1) Data Pre-processing
(2) To analyze the bestselling product, need to use the aggregation function on quantity and find out the total price of products.
(3) By using a heatmap from the seaborn library to analyze the correlation between features.
(4) Splitting the data
(5) Based on parameter RMSE identify the best model
(6) Predicting the Sales

## Data Preprocessing
- **Handling missing values**: Removed or imputed missing `CustomerID`
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracted date features from `InvoiceDate`
- **Data Normalization**: Standardized numerical features for better model performance

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Top Selling Products**: Identified most frequently purchased items
- **Customer Segmentation**: Clustered customers based on spending behavior
- **Sales Trends**: Analyzed seasonal patterns and peak purchasing times

## Machine Learning Models Used:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **Lasso Regression**
- **Ridge Regression**

### ðŸ“Œ Model Evaluation Metrics while Training and Testing:
Different machine learning models were evaluated based on their fitting time. Some models showed significantly faster processing times, indicating efficiency in handling e-commerce datasets.
